# YouTube Consumer Usage Analysis

## Background
The YouTube Consumer Usage Analysis project is an in-depth exploration into the user interaction patterns with YouTube. Our aim was to uncover meaningful insights into user viewing habits, popular content trends, and regional content preferences. Through this project, we were eager to understand the underlying relationships within the data, such as the connection between users' geographical locations and their video preferences, as well as identifying the most popular genres in terms of likes. Our choice of YouTube as a platform was driven by our regular use and familiarity with it, coupled with the opportunity to work with real-time data and develop our PL/SQL skills. The datasets include the daily updated YouTube Trending Video Dataset, Global YouTube Statistics 2023, and YouTube Statistics Dataset.

## Importance of Analysis
This analysis holds significant value for multiple stakeholders in the digital content and marketing realm. For content creators, it offers insights into what genres and types of videos are resonating with audiences, guiding them in creating more engaging content. Marketers and advertisers can use these findings to tailor their strategies to specific user groups and regions, maximizing the impact of their campaigns. Additionally, the project provides a hands-on experience with real-time data analysis, enhancing our understanding of user behavior on digital platforms.

## Database Description
Our analysis utilized a comprehensive dataset encompassing various aspects of YouTube usage. This included details about user demographics, video statistics like likes, dislikes, views, and comments, as well as channel-specific information such as subscriber counts and content types. The relational nature of this data allowed us to explore intricate connections between different data points, providing a multi-dimensional view of user interaction on YouTube.

## Solutions and Findings
Our approach involved a series of SQL and PL/SQL queries to extract and analyze data, leading to a range of findings. We discovered trends such as the most liked video categories, the channels with the highest subscriber count, and variations in user preferences across different regions. These insights not only shed light on the current state of content consumption on YouTube but also highlight potential areas for growth and innovation in content creation.
